  <h2>Scenario #1 brief</h2>

  <div class="panel panel-primary text-center">
    <div class="panel-heading">Continuous intravenous infusion of analgesic</div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    
    <p>Mr TCK is a 30 Chinese man who has recently been diagnosed as having an inflammatory arthritis of unknown cause. 
    While waiting to complete his diagnostic work-up, 
    you have prescribed a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, 
    empirically named here T03, to relieve his painful right knee. 
    Apart from his arthritis, he is clinically well and does not have evidence of liver or kidney disease.</p>
	
	<p>T03 is a newly licensed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. 
	The dose you chose is based on the standard dose recommended by the manufacturer, 75mg twice a day. 
	It is a relatively well absorbed drug with an average bioavailability of about 90%. 
	It is primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism,with no active metabolites. 
	Its plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6-8 hours. 
	Large scale clinical trials suggest that analgesic effects are on average observable at plasma concentrations exceeding 2.5mg/L, 
	while anti-inflammatory effects require peak concentrations of at least 5mg/L. 
	Plasma concentrations greater than 7mg/L may be associated with a higher risk of hepatoxicity.</p>
